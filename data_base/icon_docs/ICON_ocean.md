# Ocean[#](#ocean)

The ocean component of ICON consists of three parts:

-

[The ocean model](#ref-ocean-model) itself (referred to as ICON-O)

-

[The sea-ice module](#ref-ocean-seaice)

-

and the [bio-geochemistry module HAMOCC](#ref-ocean-biogeochem).

Additionally, an [ocean skin parameterisation](#ref-ocean-skin) is available.

## Ocean model components[#](#ocean-model-components)

### Ocean model[#](#ocean-model)

The ocean model ICON-O ([Korn 2018](../literature/literature.html#term-Korn-2018); [Korn et al. 2022](../literature/literature.html#term-Korn-et-al.-2022)) solves the hydrostatic Boussinesq equations, the classical set of dynamical equations for global ocean dynamics.
ICON-O uses, as the atmosphere, an icosahedral–triangular C grid.
The global grid of ICON-O can be locally refined to create a “computational telescope” that zooms into a region of interest.
The numerics of ICON-O share similarities to the atmosphere component but also have important differences.
Both components use a mimetic discretization of discrete differential operators, but ICON-O uses the novel concept of Hilbert-space compatible reconstructions to calculate volume and tracer fluxes on the staggered ICON grid (see [Korn 2018](../literature/literature.html#term-Korn-2018)).
The numerical scheme of ICON-O allows for generalized vertical coordinates: of particular importance here are the depth-based z-level coordinate and the so-called z-star coordinate where all water levels are stretched locally according to a factor depending on the sea-surface elevation and the water depth.

Several parameterizations for sub-grid processes are available in ICON-O.
Upper-ocean vertical mixing is realized by a turbulent kinetic energy scheme following [Gaspar et al. 1990](../literature/literature.html#term-Gaspar-et-al.-1990).
Deep-ocean mixing can be either approximated by constant background values of a vertical diffusivity or a constant value for turbulent kinetic energy.
Furthermore, ICON-O has the option of applying the novel energetically consistent parameterization IDEMIX ([Olbers and Eden 2013](../literature/literature.html#term-Olbers-and-Eden-2013)) for internal-wave driven mixing (see [Brüggemann et al. 2024](../literature/literature.html#term-Bruggemann-et-al.-2024) for details).
Horizontal dissipation of momentum is achieved by harmonic and biharmonic operators where Smagorinsky and Leith closures can be applied to specify the horizontal viscosities.
In ICON-O simulations that are too coarse to resolve mesoscale eddies, a structure-preserving formulation of the Gent and McWilliams parameterization can be applied (see [Korn 2018](../literature/literature.html#term-Korn-2018) for details).

### Sea-ice model[#](#sea-ice-model)

The sea ice model is part of ICON-O. It consists of a dynamic and a thermodynamic component.
Sea ice thermodynamics describe freezing and melting by a single-category, zero-layer formulation ([Semtner 1976](../literature/literature.html#term-Semtner-1976)). The current sea ice dynamics are based on the sea ice dynamics component of the Finite-Element Sea Ice Model (FESIM) ([Danilov et al. 2015](../literature/literature.html#term-Danilov-et-al.-2015)). The sea ice model solves the momentum equation for sea ice with an elastic–viscous–plastic (EVP) rheology.
Since ICON-O and FESIM use different variable staggering, a wrapper is needed to transfer variables between the ICON-O grid and the sea ice dynamics component (see [Korn et al. 2022](../literature/literature.html#term-Korn-et-al.-2022)).
A new sea ice dynamics model has been developed to bypass these limitations (see [Mehlmann and Korn 2021](../literature/literature.html#term-Mehlmann-and-Korn-2021)) and will be employed in the future.

### Ocean biogeochemistry model[#](#ocean-biogeochemistry-model)

The ocean biogeochemistry component is provided by HAMOCC6 ([Ilyina et al. 2013](../literature/literature.html#term-Ilyina-et-al.-2013)). It simulates at least 20 biogeochemical tracers in the water column, following an ex- tended nutrient, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus approach, also including dissolved organic matter, as described in [Six and Maier-Reimer 1996](../literature/literature.html#term-Six-and-Maier-Reimer-1996).
It also simulates the upper sediment by 12 biologically active layers and a burial layer to represent the dissolution and decomposition of inorganic and organic matter as well as the diffusion of pore water constituents.
The co-limiting nutrients consist of phosphate, nitrate, silicate, and iron.
A fixed stoichiometry for all organic compounds is assumed.

### Ocean warm layer and cold skin[#](#ocean-warm-layer-and-cold-skin)

The ocean surface layer often features a warm layer caused by solar radiation penetrating up to 3 meters, resulting in a strong diurnal cycle. Also a cold skin develops due to cooling effects of surface latent and sensible heat fluxes, influencing the top millimeter of the ocean.

The ICON implementation is based on the ideas of [Zeng and Beljaars 2005](../literature/literature.html#term-Zeng-and-Beljaars-2005) with modifications from [Takaya, Bidlot, Beljaars and Janssen 2010](../literature/literature.html#term-Takaya-Bidlot-Beljaars-and-Janssen-2010).
The following applications are currently supported:

-

atmospheric forecasts

-

forecasts coupled to an ocean

-

full data assimilation (DA) with cycling of the variables sst_warm_layer and sst_cold_cycle including weak coupling to ocean DA.

The ocean surface layer parameterisation components - warm layer and cold_skin - can be turned on separately with the parameters itype_oskin_warm and itype_oskin_cold (0/1 meaning off/activated respectively).

## Model configurations[#](#model-configurations)

### Configuring ICON-O on Levante (DKRZ)[#](#configuring-icon-o-on-levante-dkrz)

To set up an ICON-O model simulation, it is recommended to use the tool make_target_runscript.
Before, this script can be applied, a template for an ocean simulation needs to be copied into ./run.
We suggest to begin with the exp.ocean_omip template:

cd run/
cp checksuite.ocean_internal/omip/exp.ocean_omip .
./make_target_runscript in_script=exp.ocean_omip \
in_script=exec.iconrun \
EXPNAME=exp.ocean_omip \
cpu_time=00:10:00 \
no_of_nodes=1 \
openmp_threads=4 \
account_no=<your-project-number>

This generate the run/exp.ocean_omip.run.
In this run script several replacements need to be done:

RXBY -> Replace with desired grid type, there are templates for certain configurations like R2B4, R2B6, and R2B8
ZZZ -> Replace with desired vertical grid, e.g. L72
NNN -> Replace with desired vertical coordinate type: 0 for zlev and 1 for zstar

After this basic configuration, a first simulation can be started by:

sbatch exp.ocean_omip.run

Once the model is running, a directory is generated ./experiments/exp.ocean_omip, where the model output is saved.

### Configuring HAMOCC[#](#configuring-hamocc)

Similar to the ICON-O ocean-only, a configuration including HAMOCC can be setup using the make_target_runscript tool. To begin with, you can use the hamocc_omip_10days template for running HAMOCC in serial mode (non-concurrent). This template is for R2B4 grid.

cd run/
cp checksuite.ocean_internal/hamocc/exp.hamocc_omip_10days .
./make_target_runscript in_script=exp.hamocc_omip_10days \
in_script=exec.iconrun \
EXPNAME=exp.hamocc_omip_10days \
cpu_time=00:10:00 \
no_of_nodes=1 \
openmp_threads=4 \
account_no=<your-project-number>
sbatch exp.hamocc_omip_10days.run

To run HAMOCC on concurrent mode use the exp.test_concurrent_hamocc_omip_10day template instead.

## Ocean diagnostics[#](#ocean-diagnostics)

With ICON-O not only the prognostic variables but also a multitude of other diagnostic variables can be saved.
In general, the output is configured within the output_nml namelist sections by blocks similar to this example:

&output_nml
filetype = 5
output_filename = "${EXPNAME}_P1M_3d"
output_start = "${start_date}"
output_end = "${end_date}"
output_interval = "P1M"
filename_format = "<output_filename>_<datetime2>"
operation = "mean"
file_interval = "${file_interval}"
mode = 1
include_last = .FALSE.
output_grid = .TRUE.
ml_varlist = 'to','so','u','v','w','A_veloc_v','A_tracer_v_to','A_tracer_v_so',
'normal_velocity','rho','rhopot','mass_flux',
'heat_content_liquid_water','swrab','rsdoabsorb',
'group:oce_eddy'
/

Here, the following definitions apply:

filetype: 5 for netcdf
output_filename: first part of the filename, e.g."${EXPNAME}_P1M_3d"
filename_format: structure of the filename, e.g. "<output_filename>_<datetime2>"
output_start: ???
output_end: ???
output_interval: Specify how often an output should be written. "P1M" means every month an output will be written.
file_interval: Specify the interval once a new file will be opened. "P1Y" means every year a new file will be created.
operation: Specify if a snapshot (delete the line) or a time average ("mean") will be written.
mode: ????
include_lat: ????
output_grid: If .TRUE. the grid will be written to the file
ml_varlist: a list of variable names specified by `add_var` in the model, please use single quotes (') to encapsulate each variable.

Most output variables are structured in groups.
The most important groups are:

oce_default -> default model output
oce_essentials -> ???
ice_default -> default ice output
ocean_monitor -> globally integrated quantities
ocean_moc -> diagnostics regarding meridional overturning and heat transport
oce_eddy -> diagnostics for products of eddy quantities like eddy kinetic energy
oce_layers -> diagnostics for analysis in isopycnal space
oce_vmix_tke -> diagnostics of the TKE mixing scheme
oce_vmix_iwe -> diagnostics of the internal wave mixing scheme
oce_ts_budget -> diagnostics for temperature and salinity budgets

Within the post-processing toolbox [pyicon](https://gitlab.dkrz.de/m300602/pyicon/-/tree/master/pyicon) there are several example python notebooks that illustrate how different diagnostics can be applied to study ocean dynamics.
